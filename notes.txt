- Rename the settime property to onChange.

- The onChange should give the value of the control, so no name of the input should be given. The exact way of usage of the component will be.
    <TimeInput onChange={function} onError={function} />
- State changes inside of the component should be from the component tree (setState, state), so if the value of an input changes,
 it should never be by setting the input directly (e.target.value = "something"), but instead make use of the render method. (value={theStateValue}).
- The component should be completely isolated, so if you would just copy the file to another projects it should work there.
